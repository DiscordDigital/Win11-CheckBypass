# Win11-CheckBypass
A very simple script to bypass all checks when upgrading Windows 10 to Windows 11 using the ISO file.
## How to use
1. Download the bat file to the system.
2. Right click the file and "Run as Administrator".
3. Mount your Windows 11 ISO file by double clicking it.
4. Run the setup as usual, then CheckBypass should report that it removed the appraiserres.dll twice.

Use at your own risk.
